He is a well known figure field of structural engineering and mechanics. His experties are in behaviour of structures under dynamic loads including seismic forces. He was on a three day visit to Thailand and Dr Krishna invited him to come visit the AIT and have a small interaction with students. During his visit to the lab he talked on various topic including Structure Dynamics, Earthquake, Damages, Progressive Collapse, Blast Loading, Retrofitting and other. He asked students to have 'ASK" in them.

**A - Attitude

Our students at the lab are long following Prof Murty and his lectures and they used this opportunity to ask questions that one never get to ask in a recorded video. They all explained him about their researches and ask for his suggestions regarding their work.

One of the student Mr. Kim also demonstrated his sensor to Prof. Murty that he has developed.
