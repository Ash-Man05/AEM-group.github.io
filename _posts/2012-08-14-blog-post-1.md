Prof CVR Murthy from Department of Civil Engineering in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras visited the students of Chaitanya lab. He is a well known figure field of structural engineering and mechanics. His experties are in behaviour of structures under dynamic loads including seismic forces. He was on a three day visit to Thailand and Dr Krishna invited him to come visit the AIT and have a small interaction with students. During his visit to the lab he talked on various topic including Structure Dynamics, Earthquake, Damages, Progressive Collapse, Blast Loading, Retrofitting and other. He asked students to have 'ASK" in them.

A - Attitude

S - Skill

K - Knowledge

Our students at the lab are long following Prof Murty and his lectures and they used this opportunity to ask questions that one never get to ask in a recorded video. They all explained him about their researches and ask for his suggestions regarding their work.

One of the student Mr. Kim also demonstrated his sensor to Prof. Murty that he has developed. He has developed the low cost sensors for recordingthe structural response.

This has been a great learning opportunity for the students from the Chaitanya lab. We hope in future that we get many more such opportunities with the impressive figures of Structural engineering like Dr Murty.
