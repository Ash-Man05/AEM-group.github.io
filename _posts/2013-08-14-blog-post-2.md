The students attended lectures at both the Hongo campus as well as Nomada Campuses where they received lectures from some of the prominent faculties of uTokyo and professionals from the various fields. The lectures covered topics like sustainability, Disaster management and recovery, bridge and wind engineering, AI, international affairs, structural and earthquake engineering, urban planning, clean and renewable energy, neuroethology and reinsurance. The students met and had lunch with Prof Kishi sensei. They briefed him about their country and research work and also learned from his wisdom

These lectures taught the students importance of planning the future infrastructure sensibly with minimum impact on the environment. They students were also encouraged to use the clean energy and employ it in their fields. The disaster prevention and the risk management along with the smart technologies are the other important aspects that were explained to them by the professors  

The students visited the various labs on the campus where they saw the technology of the past as well as future. The lab tour included visit to Hiroi lab, Inami Namiki lab, wind tunnel, shake table at Meguro lab. These lab visits helped them in opening up their vision to the broader field and use the present day technologies like virtual reality, clean energy, disaster prevention, camouflage and others in solving the problems.
